</div>

## About
- This is the backend server made on Express.js for the MSIT NOTES website.
- It performs basic operations such as fetching files, uploading files and other basic utilities.

## Purpose of Our Website  

- We envisioned a website to help the students of MSIT with the academic material collection.

- A single platform where one can find everything ranging from assignments to viva material collected from the batch 2021.

- We are determined to deliver and keep the website updated for future batches.

## Our Expertise Unlike Namita Thapar ;)

- We provide memory-based viva questions which are very specific to MSIT.

- Constant updates on class notes and assignments for upcoming batches.

- Highly Structured content.

- We accept content from different batches to maintain uniqueness.
